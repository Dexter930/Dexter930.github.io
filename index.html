        <p><strong>FOOD</strong> is my favorite thing in the whole house.</p>
        <p>Today We'll talk about food. I love it. Obviously dog food does not count i mean who actually likes that stuff its more of a last resort. Im talking about human food. When the humans have dinner its my time to shine. I put on the puppy eyes and sit at there chairs hoping that they drop some crumbs for me. Just yesterday it happened. I got half a piece of meatloaf all to my self. </p>

        <h3 class="post-title">A tragic story of some Geese</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
          <p>While the humans are gone I often get bored. I end up spending most of my time thinking and sleeping. Today was different though. While the humans were gone I happened to noticed two geese outside.</p>
          <p>The love bird geese were walking around the pond. I didnt bark out of curiosity to see what they would do. The girl seemed to be pregnant. I named them Bonnie and Clyde. They have not stop coming back to the pond out side. It seems they live here now. Clyde spends his time looking for food. Bonnie looks after her children. They eventually noticed me but we quickly became friends as if we were neighbors. One day i didnt see them I didnt see them for 2 weeks in a row I am a dog but i know when somehting is wrong. I searched for them but when I got to there makeshift home all that was left were some bones and feathers. I was very sad but at the end of the day im just a dog. RIP Bonnie, Clyde, and there 4 children.</p>
